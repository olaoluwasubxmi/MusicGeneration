[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Better that I change my number so you can't explain
Violence in the night, violence in the night
Priors, priors, do you have any priors?
Well, that one time
I'll be honest, I'll be honest
We all liars
Let it go
[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'll be honest, we all liars
I'm pulled over and I got priors
Guess we goin' down, guess who's goin' to jail?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
God gon' post my bail tonight

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Don't you curse at mе on text, why you try to hit the flex?
I hold up, likе, "What?"
I scroll, I scroll up like, "Next"
Guess who's getting 'exed?
Like, next
Guess who's getting 'exed?
You made a choice that's your bad, single life ain't so bad
But we ain't finna go there
Something's off, I'll tell you why
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
What a grand plan to sell you out

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
God in my cells, that's my celly
Made in the image of God, that's a selfie
Pray five times a day, so many felonies
Who gon' post my bail? Lord, help me
Hol' up, Donda, I'm with your baby when I touch back road
Told him, "Stop all of that red cap, we goin' home"
Not me with all of these sins, castin' stones
This might be the return of The Throne (Throne)
Hova and Yeezus, like Moses and Jesus
You are not in control of my thesis
You already know what I think 'bout think pieces
Before you ask, he already told you who he think he is
Don't try to jail my thoughts and think precincts
I can't be controlled with programs and presets
Reset
On my cell, in my cell tonight
Don't have to see you to touch you
This is what braille look like, it's on sight
If they take me to jail, call my girl, tell her send my mail
We know what Hell look like
Still, it's a hell of a life, yikes
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?
Guess who's goin' to jail tonight?

More than I can say for you
Before the sons and the daughters
Before the sun and the water
More than I can say for you
But the truth still for you
Once I saw what the Lord do
God, the Son, all the glory
God, the Father, like Maury
Don't care what you say, nothin' on me
I don't care 'bout the lawyer fees
I don't care 'bout your loyalties
God will solve it all for me
Trust man, he a failure
Trust, and God'll heal ya'
Dustin, he a Hoffman
Don't fall what they offerin', uh
Fall far too often, yeah, call God but don't call enough

[Verse 3: Vory]
Devil on my shoulders, I can't let 'em breathe
Brush 'em off my sleeve, I'm filled with memories
Pray they remember me, oh, oh-oh
And I know there's an angel watchin' over me
(All times), I inhaled and breathed
They hearts are filled with greed
Okay, now they want the old me
Not too big on peoples talkin'
Okay, now they gotta show me
Okay, okay, Devil's talkin' to me, angel's talkin' to me
But Angels start to tell me, "It's okay to not feel okay"
I know that you'd be proud if you was here today
But it's okay 'cause I'm okay

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
First, it go viral, then they get digital
Then they get critical, no, I'm not doin' no interview
Mask on my face, you can't see what I'm finna do
Had to move away from people that's miserable
Don't wanna link you, I ain't finna sit with you
Ain't finna talk to you, ain't finna get with you
Don't get me mad 'cause I don't wanna injure you
She put my paintings inside of her living room
Look at the problems and issues I'm livin' through
They tryna drown me, I rise to my pinnacle
Walked through the block like the neighborhood general
Drop me the lo' and then that's where I send it to
I was forgettin' you, now I remember, now I remember
Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?
I got this God power, that's my leverages
I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em "sorry," they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me
Nah, nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
Nah, I get 'em fast, see
You feel a way, then go pull up and get me
Might do somethin' wild if I feel like you press me
[Chorus: Kanye West]
We off the grid, grid, grid
This for my kid, kid, kid
For when my kid, kid, kids have kids
Everything we did for the crib

[Outro: Kanye West]
Pray for what folks and them did
Only thing we pray God forgive-give-give
May God forbid-bid-bid
He hit one of the kids, kids, kids
Took off His list, list, list
Look what they did, did, did
Pray for the crib, crib, crib
Some say A-A-Adam could never be bla-a-ack
'Cause a black man'll never share his rib, rib, rib, rib, rib, rib

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah
[Bridge: The Weeknd & KayCyy]
Oh-oh, I know You won't (I know You won't)
I know You won't (Oh), oh (Oh, yeah)
I know You won't, I know that You look over us (I know)
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, "What do you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple

A single Black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse outta debty
I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people servin' no time

Hard to keep my focus on what matters
Mandem hit my line like, "Some **** just got hit up on your block"
You can rest assured it's not us
'Cause we been out the wavе catchin' waves
They say, "We ain't seen you on thе block"
'Cause I been out the way
Chasin' millions in my sleep, I found the better way
Somewhere on an island, let me kick it, this my getaway
I pour up a drink for all my **** who ain't see the day
Tryna finish this with who I started with
Way too many fallen soldiers, no, I can't forgot
Hope they got headphones up in Heaven
You can vibe out and just hear this ****
It's just certain **** you can't forget

And we ain't see it, I lost my brother when we was millionaires
I wasn't scared to die, but him, that was my biggest fear
I got your son and your daughter like you still here
Know how it feel to lose a brother, we got a bond still
Twenty-six years, pops got out to see his son killed
And I don't give a **** if I hang with a Crip, I see blood still
I can be the cleanest millionaire, I'm from the mud still
Died with his chain on, I call it blood diamonds
It's to the point I drop my own lo' so they could find us
And it's been months and they still haven’t
Kanye did it for the city, he co-signed

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, it's too early
What the hell you doin' wakin' me up at 5:30?
Why the hell are you worried?
Play somethin' that is very, very vibe-worthy
I don't know want my mind alerting
People sayin' tweetin' gonna make you die early
How 'bout have my heart hurtin'?
Hold it all inside, that could make you die early
Go on and get your best attorney
Something's there, feel it when I heard it
Just release the spirit, let it flow though
How these **** leaving now with one leg like Flo-Jo?
Nail me to the cross with long nails, like Coko
Free Throat Coat for the throat goats
Even if I gotta do it solo, even if I gotta do it with no promo
I ain't got my point across
'Til we finally get across and pass the point
So there's a couple things that I gotta quote
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
I ain't never question what you was askin' for
I gave you every single thing you was askin' for
I don't understand how anybody could ask for more
Got a list of even more, I just laugh it off
I be goin' through things I had to wrote
Celebrity drama that only Brad'll know
Too many family secrets, somebody passin' notes
Things I cried about, I found laughable
Lil' baby Jesus, ain't laughing, no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know
The big man upstairs ain't laughin', no
Don't involve yourself in things they ain't have to know

You know I'm not about it
Showed you my all
I let you into my thoughts

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow in love
One last sparkle to follow in my light
One last sparkle to follow

[Interlude: Buju Banton]
Okay, I didn't throw a fit when you said you wanted to leave
I told you I loved you, but you didn't believe
You were too easily fooled, so easily deceived
By some dude who's more rather into greed
Played by your emotions, you were swamped by your needs
Told me, I didn't believe, you said I was out to deceive, ahaha
You said that I lie, how did I? I told you everything, didn't I?
But you just could not believe, man, I'm so peeved
Your friends all up in your head even when we're in bed
Your mind's elsewhere, and you say you care? Haha
I'm laughin' at you all, you think you got me? No, no
My back ain't against the wall (The wall, the wall, the wall, the wall, the wall)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle drag you down
Who knows when was the last time you felt the love
One last sparkle to follow in my light (Right on)
One last sparkle to follow

No more promos, no more photos
No more logos, no more chokeholds
We on Bezos, we get payrolls
Trips to Lagos, connect like LEGOs
Make this final, make this, my eyes closed
Burn false idols, Jesus' disciples
I can feel your pain now, I done bled my vein out
New level the game now, simulation changed
No more problems, no more argue
No more askin', "Who really arе you?"
I know the real you, you know we feel you
You know Hе hears you, you know we with you
Straight from Beirut, Chicago, Beirut
You cray? We cray, too
You pray? We pray, too
Never too late for Him to save you
This your movie 'cause no one can play you
Devil, lay down, Devil, lay down
This that level, make devils pray now (Heaven and Hell)
Hold up, no peace, hold up, police
Don't call police, just stay focused (Is on Earth)
Pray for new life, pray for new breath
Hey, Lord, make sure it's safe for who's left (Heaven and Hell)
Know you can't find a place to rest
Know the Lord my bulletproof vest (Is on Earth)
When we survive, know that we blessed

And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What do you want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son's mother
The man I describe in the introduction as being so decidedly different
My son (When you're runnin' outta timе and you're not outta time)
And what made thе project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (Change the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

It's the kingdom (It's the kingdom)

Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "****, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)
I never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tepoztlán, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel
My sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took a L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that
But you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me, it kinda feels like
Me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids
Have all been incarcerated through this journey
And we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals
For being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in
Is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him
And it is what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one
My father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction
Into the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man
I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home
Now I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us
But for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community
Who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)

[Intro: Kanye West]
If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"
You better not hit me with a "H-E-Y"
It better be like "Hiii" with a bunch of I's
Or "Heyyy" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey
Is to lay me or play me a bigger flex though?
'Cause you know you'd never live up to my ex though
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO
[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Most insane out-of-body experience
And I repent for everything I'ma do again (I accept Him)
And I repent for everything I'ma do again

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir & Kanye West]
Thank You, thank You, thank You for Your mercy, make me new
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
I repent for everything that I'ma do again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again
Last night don't count
This morning don't count

If you take the ride, please don't close your eyes, uh

Look, mama, I made it (Grrt)
[Verse: Pop Smoke]
Look, I remember the days, same 'fit for a week straight
I used to eat fifty-cent cake, now it's Philippe's
It's Philippe's for the steak
Buy it, I don't care what it cost
And I always keep a pole
I did a hundred on a pro
If you droppin' a woo, we come where you live
Glock 9, infrared
Pull up and еmpty the clip
Dread had the strap all summеr
In the Floss movin' reckless
Do not play with me, ****, I keep a K with me

****, we made it (Grr, woo)

Well, Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me
Wrap Your arms around with Your mercy
Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me
I give up on doin' things my way
And tell me everything's gonna be alright, oh

[Verse]
When you said give me a ring, you really meant a ring, huh?
Turned out to be more than just a fling, huh?
Three hours to get back from Palm Springs, huh?
Who you know spend an hour in Walgreens, huh?
You know you'll always be my favorite prom queen
Even when we in dad shoes or mom jeans
Too many complaints made it hard for me to think
Would you shut up? I can't hear myself drink
We used to do the freak like seven days a week
It's the best collab since Taco Bell and KFC, uh
Talk to me nicely, don't come at me loud
You had a Benz at sixteen, I could barely afford a Audi
How you gon' try to say sometimes it's not about me?
Man, I don't know what I would do without me
Billionaire sport, step up to the court
They rented a room, we bought the resort
God got me, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time and silence a luxury
Cussin' at your baby mama, guess that's why they call it custody
God got us, baby, God got the children
The devil run the playground, but God own the buildin'
Time and space is a luxury
But you came here to show that you still in love with me
Startin' to feel like you ain't been happy for me lately, darlin'
'Member when you used to come around and serenade me, woah
But I guess it's gone different in a different direction lately
Tryna do the right thing with the freedom that you gave me (Wheezy outta here)
Your gun off safety
Speak first, don't break me
Harsh words, you're angry
Lord, don't take me, oh, oh
[Chorus]
Well, Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me
Wrap Your arms around with Your mercy
Lord, I need You to wrap Your arms around me
I give up on doin' things my way
And tell me everything's gonna be alright, oh (Wheezy outta here)

[Intro: Roddy Ricch & Kanye West]
Life change when you famous
I remember, back before the chains, we was nameless
Went through stages just to hop on new stages
Open up your eyes, man, they only entertainers
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Yeah, soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Jesus saved my soul)
And I cannot sell my soul
[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch, Kanye West & both]
I've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
And I'm just a product of whatever I was raised in
This money sanctified, so I gotta say it again
They said I was mad at the Grammys
But I'm lookin' at my Grammy right now
Pulled up on Ye, and I said, "They don't understand me"
I just want my dawg to pipe down
'Cause when you really came from the trenches
You was raised in the trenches (Mm)
You feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (Mm)
I hope God can forgive me for the days that I was sinnin' (Mhm)

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch & Kanye West]
The truth is only what you get away with, huh?
(Man, all these lyin' ****)
I said the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
Ayy, that's why a lot of these **** be fakin', huh
Made it through the trials and tribulations, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, uh, well, well, here goes
Well, here goes, but here goes
I was one of them weirdos of the pure soul
That would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
Every color Girbauds, every Cutlass is cold
Every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gangbang
How we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom before Chief Keef was "Bang, Bang"
Always had mob ties
Stood on my six points, how could I not rise?
Love, truth, peace, freedom, justice, but I'm not five
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
This Southside, and we outside
And for all the guys that went to the White House and said, "Free the old man"
Every day I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
I can give a dollar to every person on Earth
Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'
We gon' have to square up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then, uh
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
My favorite place to send it

Here go all your problems again (I thank God)
Three, two, one, you're pinned (I thank God)
Uncle now he back in the pen' (Hallelujah)
Auntie shut down again
Did she finally come to life? (Thank you, Jesus)
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
[Verse 1]
Don't you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feelin' low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone (Loosen right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floatin' on a silver lining (In the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining
And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, "Get behind me"
And all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me

[Interlude]
Hallelujah (Thank you, Jesus)
Hallelujah (Yes)

Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back to the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Thoughts, you had penciled 'em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life

[Verse 2]
You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Brought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free
Floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I'm free

I said one thing they ain't like, threw me out like they ain't care for me
Threw me out like I'm garbage, huh?
And that food that y'all took off my table
You know that feed my daughters, huh? (Mmm)
But I ain't really mad, 'cause when I look at it
I'm getting them snakes up out my grass and, ****, that's a good habit
I'm ready for war, let's get at 'em
And teaming up ain't gon' help 'em
'Cause beating the odds too deep
Just me and God, ****, ****, I'm good at it
Matter of fact, I'm great at it, my cell phone back at it
I know these people gon' try to tell me how to talk
Don't know what I seen or what I was taught
My mama worked two or three jobs to take care of three of her kids, my uncles watched
Yeah, we was raised by the crack addicts
Mmm, raised by the drug dealers, killers, and the junkies (Junkies)
Mama couldn't save us 'cause she had to get the—
Mama couldn't save us 'cause she had to get the money
Feel like your world falling, getting too hard to catch it, ain't it?
You and your girl arguin', you don't like how she actin' lately
Giving it everything that you can give and you don't get half the patience
You was busy hustlin', the things come with your hustle
They got in her head, corrupted her
Yeah, that's probably what happened, ain't it?
Large amount of capital, invested in myself
Underground, I ain't even have a basement, I read the affidavit
Let's see what it is with you
Only thing I did to you
Was always keep it real and true
Guilty, guess they gon' have to take me

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin’ by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I’ve been through, I wish I was dreaming
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus Lord)
I watched so many people leave, I see 'em change by the season
That's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin’ in
I know I madе a promise that I’d never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losing all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I’ve been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain’t no love there
You've been down so much, you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while they introduce a party, they say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousin in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they've been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I had nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night tears when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, could I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
And better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama's steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
Now she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
And she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
But is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin', then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
He even let him get they last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "****, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus Lord)
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
Uh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful
Thank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertuğrul (Jesus)
Every knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)
To the monk who visit Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Sheesh)
It's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor
Back from the great and yonder, the son of man and the son of Donda (Jesus)
I never rolled the jix or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)
But I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda
Earthquakes'll strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)
What the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)
In Tenochtitlan, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)
I shift the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal
The God is interstellar while you fellas remain local
My bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)
As sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)
I could change the world like Yakub with two pieces of steel
My sword or my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne
But when you great, they wanna say you took an L, José Castillo (Jesus)
I'm in the fight here, fight here, for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)
My rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears
Thirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier
It's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)
It's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)

Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Donnie, Ye, what up, ****?
Get that money and **** forget 'em
I ain't need 'em, but my moms is with 'em (Jesus)
Thirty-eight, look how the streets did 'em (Lord)
All these trophies, but where do I sit 'em?
I was born to rock a crown, **** yeah, I knocked it down
Holy water, ****, but out here, we turn to brown (Jesus)
Donnie, if you ain't loyal, you from a different soil (Lord)
Your flame too low for that water to boil
If I wasn't rappin', the calls would stop
You ain't really happy for me, you mad that I popped (Jesus)
**** a car, five houses like, "Look what I copped" (Lord)
Devil like, "Jesus Christ, he gotta be stopped"
I don't say "What's up?", you basically blocked
You see it on my hip, just know that it's cocked (Jesus)
Always look 'em in the face when I deal with my opp (Lord)
I'm from the bottom, but Lord knows it's better up top, ****

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yeah, viral pictures (Viral), Bible scriptures (Yeah)
One thing 'bout the devil, he's liable to get you (Yeah, Jesus)
Long as my good days outweigh my bad days (Lord)
I don't count the money, I just know how much the bag weighs (I know)
Broke down soon as I seen him bring the coffin in
Lord knows, I just really wanna see you walk again (Uh, Jesus)
Million dollars cashiers check to the offerin' (Lord)
They can talk about me all they want, I'ma talk to Him (Uh-huh)
Some **** get shot in they mouth, never talk again (Yuh)
After that, they go and get veneers or the porcelain (Jesus)
We all need Him, is you ready to meet Him? (Lord, ready?)
Doin' dumb ****, but keep tryin' for your freedom
Uh, if you don't die, then you try again (Yeah)
You get your angel wings, then you fly again (Jesus, fly)
Ain't no "I" in "Team", it's an "I" in "Win" (Lord, win)
They got they eye on me, I got my eye on Him (What's up?)
[Verse 5: Styles P]
Some fam died, some friends died
I am feeling rage on the inside, where is mine? (Jesus)
Love and hate is a thin line, get two for the tenth time (Lord)
Dyin' on the eleventh, my ****
I'm just down here stuntin' on the seventh, my ****
By the way, is a ghetto up in heaven, my ****? (Jesus)
If it is, keep the chariot revvin', my **** (Lord)
Yeah, that's what my momma be sayin'
And before you go to war, know it's honor in prayin'
There'll be vomit on the toilet after last night (Jesus)
These **** ballin' they move, yeah, they gotta be playin', not the lottery (Lord)
I am in the flower, **** the pottery
Jargon is angelic, you don't get it, then pardon me
Got coke from Jesus, now I'm talkin' to Jesus (Jesus)
Real shallow ****, probably pray for a gray coupe (Lord)
Maybe the Lykan or a mansion out in the Seychelles
Ghost

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
And we done been a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
We done seen a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus Lord)

[Outro: Larry Hoover Jr. & Kanye West]
What up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr
First and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office
You might not have been the only one that could've did that, but you were the one that did do that
And with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight
You know, to me it kind of feels like, me, my mother, my brothers, and my kids have all been incarcerated through this journey and we haven't even been to jail
We have been looked at and treated as criminals for being a part of this family
My father's truth and the reality that he raised me in is that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)
Because the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him and it's what made the children of today
After twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one, my father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world
And will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples
If my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction, into the hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years
Man, he would be dead to me
I didn't sign up for that
I didn't stay on this journey this long for that
All my life, man, I've been waitin' for my father to come home
They told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home
Then they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home
I went away to Morris Brown, I graduated, and he still ain't home
Now I'm an adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated
He still not home
Now even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'
Matter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren
And they haven't been able to touch they grandfather
Even though it is not seen that way for some of us, but for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community who deserves to breathe free air
Free my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)
